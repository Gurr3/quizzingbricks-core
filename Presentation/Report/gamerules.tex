A game allows for either two or four players and consists of a series of turns, where at the start of each turn, each player decides where to place a brick on a game board of size 8x8. 
After each player has chosen where to put their brick, the player is able to request a question. After having received the question, they have to answer it correctly within a small amount of time to be allowed to place their brick on the chosen position. After this, a new turn starts. If two or more players have chosen the same position, each of those players will be asked more questions until no more than one person has answered correctly to all of the questions. When a player gets his brick added to the board, he gets a number of points added to his score that is equal to the total number of contiguous bricks that can be traced through the newly acquired position, in a linear fashion, horizontally, vertically and diagonally. The player with the highest score when the score count of any player has reached 50 has won the game.
